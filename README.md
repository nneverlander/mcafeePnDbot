Only works with bittrex

You need to modify the js files to include your bittrex and twitter API keys.

Just run tweet.js by `node tweet.js`. Beware, you might need to do some processing to check the tweets are actually coming from him and not someone tweeting at him. I didn't care enough about it to do it myself.

In case you are paranoid your sells didn't make through run `node sells.js`

If you don't want to listen to tweets but place buys and sells automatically run `node run.js`
